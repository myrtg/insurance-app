# v0.dev/Vercel-Inspired Restyling Progress

## Components Restyled

- [x] Main Page Layout (`app/page.tsx`) — deeper black bg, larger heading, more whitespace
- [x] ModelSelector (`app/components/ModelSelector.tsx`) — reduced border/shadow, deeper bg, more spacing
- [x] ChatInterface (`app/components/ChatInterface.tsx`) — reduced border/shadow, deeper bg, more padding, larger input
- [x] Message (`app/components/Message.tsx`) — card-like, minimal border, deep bg, more whitespace, larger font

## Next Steps

- [ ] Refine error and loading states for v0.dev look
- [ ] Add card-based UI for dataset match and model answers in dashboard mode
- [ ] Polish mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Review and update any remaining UI elements for consistency

## Notes
- All major interactive components now use card-based, modern, minimal styling with soft shadows, rounded corners, and clean typography.
- The chat input and buttons use pill-shaped, modern styles.
- The app is visually consistent with v0.dev/Vercel design principles, with a deep black background, large headings, and lots of whitespace.
